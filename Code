-- STEP 1: Create a staging table to preserve original data
CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging LIKE layoffs;

INSERT INTO layoffs_staging
SELECT *
FROM layoffs;

-- STEP 2: Inspect raw staging data
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging;

-- STEP 3: Identify duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER
WITH duplicate_cte AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,
                        percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
           ORDER BY company
         ) AS row_num
  FROM layoffs_staging
)
SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1;

-- STEP 4: Remove duplicate records from staging
WITH duplicate_cte AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,
                        percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
           ORDER BY company
         ) AS row_num
  FROM layoffs_staging
)
DELETE
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE employee_id IN (
  SELECT employee_id
  FROM duplicate_cte
  WHERE row_num > 1
);

-- STEP 5: Create a second staging table with row numbers for further cleaning
CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging2 (
  company TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  industry TEXT,
  total_laid_off INT DEFAULT NULL,
  percentage_laid_off TEXT,
  `date` TEXT,
  stage TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  funds_raised_millions INT DEFAULT NULL,
  row_num INT
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

-- STEP 6: Insert deduplicated data with row numbers
INSERT INTO layoffs_staging2
SELECT *,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
         PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,
                      percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
         ORDER BY company
       ) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;

-- STEP 7: Remove remaining duplicates from staging2
DELETE
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num > 1;

-- STEP 8: Standardize company names
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET company = TRIM(company);

-- STEP 9: Normalize industry labels
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

-- STEP 10: Clean country names
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';

-- STEP 11: Convert date strings to DATE format
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;

-- STEP 12: Remove rows with missing layoff data
DELETE
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
  AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- STEP 13: Fill missing industry values using self-join
UPDATE layoffs_staging2 AS t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 AS t2
  ON t1.company = t2.company
  AND t1.location = t2.location
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
  AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- STEP 14: Normalize empty strings to NULL
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- STEP 15: Drop helper column
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;

-- Final check
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;
